## 🔥 Live Features

Currently running on http://localhost:8080

Try it now:
1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Create an event**: Click on any time slot
3. **View the blue tab**: Your event appears as a blue block
4. **Click the event**: Opens in edit mode

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### WeekView Updates
- Events filtered by week range
- Positioned using absolute positioning
- Height calculated from duration (48px per hour)
- onClick handler calls `onEventClick` with event data
- Prevents event bubbling to time slot click

### EventModal Updates
- Added `onDelete` prop
- Added delete button (only shows for existing events)
- Delete button on left, Save/Cancel on right
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- API integration for delete operation

### Index.tsx Updates
- Added `handleDeleteEvent` function
- Integrated with React Query mutation
- Invalidates query cache after deletion
- Shows toast notification on success/error

## 🚀 What's Working

✅ Event creation via API
✅ Event display as blue tabs
✅ Event editing via modal
✅ Event deletion with confirmation
✅ Real-time UI updates (React Query)
✅ Accurate time positioning
✅ Hover effects
✅ Current time indicator
✅ Today highlighting
✅ Click handling (events vs time slots)

## 🎯 User Experience

The calendar now feels like Google Calendar:
- **Visual similarity**: Blue event tabs
- **Interaction pattern**: Click to view/edit
- **Smart display**: Shows more info for longer events
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate updates
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure with alerts
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Prevents accidental deletion

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Load**: React Query fetches events from API
2. **Display**: Events rendered as blue tabs
3. **Click**: Opens EventModal with event data
4. **Edit**: Updates via API, invalidates cache
5. **Delete**: Removes via API, invalidates cache
6. **Refresh**: React Query re-fetches, UI updates

Enjoy your fully functional Google Calendar clone! 📅✨
